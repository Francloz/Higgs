# Higgs

This repository serves as a learning tool to train a model to detect the Higgs Boson particles using the
renown CERN dataset.

But this this repository also serves as a generic Machine Learning framework to train several kinds of models.
All the implemented models can be found inside the model package, that can be trained
with the optimizers found in the optimization package.

For precondicioning, several methods can be found, among which are normalizers, missing data fillers,
feature extraction and feature elimination.

In order to visualize the data, you will find several useful methods defined in the plotting package.

For data manipulation, please consult the utils package.

In case that more precise tinkering of the loss and activation functions is desired, many different ones
are implemented under the function package.

For more information consult the documentation.
